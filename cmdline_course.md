This is a course to learn to use a command-line environment such as the
bash. You will feel like a nerd after learning a few commands.

1. # Introduction to Command-Line Environments
My favourite command is ls. Nano felt really difficult in the beginning
but now it's almost automatic.

2. # Navigating a UNIX System
Sudo feels a bit scary to use and changing permission as well since I'm
afraid I can cause trouble.

3. # Corpus Processing
Regular expressions are challenging. I shall get back to them with more
time.

4. # Scripting and UNIX Configuration Files
Scripts can be useful.

5. # Installing and Running Programs
Installing and running programs can be tricky but there aere ways to
make things easier.

6. # Version Control
This part was very intresting and maybe the most useful, that's why Im
desperately trying to finish it.

7. # Building Webpages using GitHub Pages
If you can handle Github with command lines you are a certified nerd.
